Hi, I'm Stallwan, an enthusiastic apprentice developer. I use open-source tools (linux, vim, ...) and I program in Rust and Python. At the moment I'm:
- learn the Rust language;
- study how virtual machines work;
- learn how to use StumpWM and GNU Emacs.

I particularly like:
- the development of programming languages and kernel;
- the Lisp programming language;
- easter-eggs;
- Lego;
- Minecraft;
- pinball;
- the great and venerable Richard Stallman.
