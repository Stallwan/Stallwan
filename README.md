Hello, I am a young and enthusiastic apprentice developer named b4b4. I code in Python, Rust and most of the known web languages. I am currently working on `wafl` which will be a functional programming language. I like freedom and health, especially free software, like Vim and Linux. Finally, I am very interested in virtual reality and more exactly in metaverse. Later on, I intend to develop an open-source metaverse based on the two notions I care about, stated above.
